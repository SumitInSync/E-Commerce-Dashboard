 E-COMMERCE SALES DASHBOARD (Power BI)

Project Overview

This project features a comprehensive, interactive Sales Performance Dashboard developed in Power BI. The goal of this dashboard is to provide the "E-COMMERCE" team with real-time visibility into their sales performance, customer behavior, and product profitability across different geographical regions and time periods.

The dashboard transforms raw transactional data into actionable insights, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions related to inventory, marketing spend, and supply chain logistics.

‚ú® Key Features & Insights

KPI Tracking: Instantly track core business health metrics: Total Sales (Amount), Average Order Value (AOV), Total Quantity Sold, and Total Profit.

Time-Series Analysis: A dedicated "Profit by Month" visualization highlights monthly performance, identifying peak seasons and underperforming periods.

Geographical Analysis: Sales and quantity are segmented by State (e.g., Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi) to identify top-performing regions.

Product Performance: Analysis of Profit by Sub-Category (Printers, Bookcases, etc.) and Quantity by Category to determine which products are driving revenue and which require attention.

Customer & Payment Deep Dive: Visualizations show sales by customer and quantity by payment mode (Credit Card, EMI, COD) for deeper behavioral insights.

Dynamic Filtering: Utilizes slicers for Quarter and State to allow for dynamic, granular exploration of the data.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

Primary Tool: Microsoft Power BI Desktop (.pbix file format)

Data Modeling: Star Schema/Snowflake principles used (inferred from the dashboard structure)

Language: Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) for custom measures and calculated columns
